# PK Hackathon 2025!
A move made for PK Hackathon 2025!
Criteria: Combat, Maneuverability, Utility

### DustDevil
DustDevil is a dynamic Sandbending ability created for the PK Hackathon 2025, masterfully blending maneuverability, combat, and utility into a single, fluid move.

### Maneuverability
When commanding a boat, a Sandbender can unleash DustDevil with a simple left-click. This conjures a powerful sand tornado that envelops and propels the boat forward at high speed, turning any body of water into an express lane. It's the perfect tool for rapid travel, escapes, or repositioning.

### Combat
When on foot, DustDevil transforms into a potent offensive weapon. A left-click will fire a concentrated, smoky sand beam that damages any foe it strikes. The beam travels swiftly towards its target, leaving a trail of swirling sand and smoke, culminating in an impact that proves the destructive power of the desert.

### Utility
The true strength of DustDevil lies in its versatility. It's a dual-purpose ability that allows a bender to seamlessly switch between high-speed traversal and aggressive combat based on their immediate needs, making it an invaluable asset in any situation.

### Config
Highly customisable config which allows for significant modification of the abilities appearance.
